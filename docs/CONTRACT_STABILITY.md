# Contract Stability & Namespace Policy (v1)

StegID v1 exports are permanently frozen.

During early development, several identifiers were introduced before the final canonical namespace was defined. These identifiers are preserved indefinitely as **legacy v1 aliases**.

## Guarantees
- All v1 exports are frozen forever
- No renames
- No removals
- No semantic changes

## Forward Development
A canonical namespace is used for new functionality.
Legacy identifiers remain fully supported via compatibility adapters.

This policy ensures protocol stability while allowing the ecosystem to evolve without breaking deployed systems.
