# Why StegID Exists

Most identity systems assume:
- continuous networks
- trusted institutions
- stable platforms
- permanent infrastructure

History suggests none of those assumptions hold forever.

StegID exists to answer a simpler question:

> “What happened — and can it still be proven if everything else is gone?”

---

## What StegID Is

StegID is a minimal system for producing **verifiable continuity records**:
- cryptographically signed
- deterministic to verify
- portable across platforms
- recoverable without networks

It does not decide what should happen next.
It proves what already happened.

---

## What StegID Is Not

StegID is not:
- an identity provider
- a database
- a blockchain
- a governance system
- a UI or service

Those can be rebuilt.
Truth cannot.

---

## Design Principles

StegID is built on a few non-negotiable principles:

- **Truth before authority**
- **Verification without trust**
- **Recovery without infrastructure**
- **Evolution without erasure**

It is intentionally boring — and intentionally durable.

---

## Why This Matters

If identity, governance, or AI systems cannot survive:
- infrastructure collapse
- platform loss
- institutional failure
- time discontinuity

Then they are conveniences, not foundations.

StegID is designed to survive being forgotten — and rediscovered.

---

## In One Sentence

StegID is a continuity-of-truth layer that can be recovered from a single artifact, on a single device, without authority.
